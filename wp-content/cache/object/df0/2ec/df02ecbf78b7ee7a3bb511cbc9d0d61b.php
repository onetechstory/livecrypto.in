<h2 id="h-difference-between-cryptocurrency-exchanges-and-trading-platforms">Difference between Cryptocurrency Exchanges and Trading Platforms</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A cryptocurrency exchange simply matches buyers with sellers like a traditional stock exchange. It is a service for exchanging crypto to fiat and vice versa. Usually, it works like this: customers send money using a bank transfer and exchange is sending them coins for their purchase.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Trading Platforms on the other hand also enable to buy of cryptocurrencies for fiat. However, the main feature that separates it from exchanges is it enables the trade of coins between people. Usually, the trading process is complicated since it requires basic trading knowledge. The buyers and the sellers dictate the price. Also, these platforms provide more features compared to exchanges.</p>
