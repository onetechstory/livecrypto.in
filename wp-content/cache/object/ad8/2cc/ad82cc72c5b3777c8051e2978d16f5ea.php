<p>It is a decentralized, open-source blockchain with smart contract functionality. Ether is the native cryptocurrency of the platform which means Ether is a token of Ethereum, unlike <a href="https://livecrypto.in/bitcoin-what-you-need-to-know-before-you-buy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin</a> which is a coin. It is also one of the most used blockchains in the market today. It was proposed in 2013 by programmerÂ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitalik_Buterin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vitalik Buterin</a> (now the world's youngest billionaire). Development was crowdfunded in 2014, and the network went live on 30Â <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/July">July</a>Â 2015, with an initial supply of 72 million coins. <strong>It is not just a platform but also a programming language on the blockchain helping developers to create distributed applications.</strong></p>

<p>Let's take a look at how it started, The ICO was the second ICO ever and took place for 42 days (22 July 2014 â€“ 2 September 2014). The ICO collected 31,500 Bitcoins that at the time were worth approximately 18,400,000 USD. Since the inception, Ethereum has only moved upwards and there is no looking back. It has been gathering a lot of interest amongst the cryptizens which has lead ETH market capitalization to reach 22.8 Billion USD with 110,824,577 ETH as its current circulating supply. It is currently valued at $213 today. The 24-hour price movements indicate that $23,641,679,834 worth of ETH was trading.</p>
