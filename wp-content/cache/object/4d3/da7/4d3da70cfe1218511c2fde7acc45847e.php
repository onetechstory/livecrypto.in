<p>A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is meant to be a medium of <a href="https://livecrypto.in/cryptocurrency-exchanges-and-trading-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exchange</a>. It is quite similar to real-world currency, except it does not have any physical embodiment, and it uses cryptography to work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Because cryptocurrencies operate independently and in a <a href="https://livecrypto.in/decentralization-vs-centralization-advantages-usage-and-security/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decentralized</a> manner, new units can be added only after certain conditions are met without a bank or a central authority. For example, with Bitcoin, only after a block has been added to the blockchain will the miner be rewarded with bitcoins, and this is the only way new bitcoins can be generated. The limit for bitcoins is 21 million; after this, no more bitcoins will be produced.</p>

<p>With cryptocurrency, the transaction cost is low to nothing at allâ€”unlike, for example, the fee for transferring money from a digital wallet to a bank account. You can make transactions at any time of the day or night, and there are no limits on purchases and withdrawals. And anyone is free to use cryptocurrency, unlike setting up a bank account, which requires documentation and other paperwork.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>International cryptocurrency transactions are faster than wire transfers too. Wire transfers take about half a day for the money to be moved from one place to another. With cryptocurrencies, transactions take only a matter of minutes or even seconds.</p>

<p>Imagine a scenario in which you want to repay a friend who bought you lunch, by sending money online to his or her account. There are several ways in which this could go wrong, including:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>The financial institution could have a technical issue, such as its systems are down or the machines arenâ€™t working properly.</li><li>Your or your friendâ€™s account could have been hackedâ€”for example, there could be a denial-of-service attack or identity theft.</li><li>The transfer limits for your or your friendâ€™s account could have been exceeded.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is a central point of failure: the bank.</p>

<p>This is why the future of currency lies with cryptocurrency. Now imagine a similar <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaction" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transaction</a> between two people using the bitcoin app. A notification appears asking whether the person is sure he or she is ready to transfer bitcoins. If yes, processing takes place: The system authenticates the userâ€™s identity, checks whether the user has the required balance to make that transaction, and so on. After thatâ€™s done, the payment is transferred and the money lands in the receiverâ€™s account. All of this happens in a matter of minutes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cryptocurrency, then, removes all the <a href="https://livecrypto.in/decentralization-vs-centralization-advantages-usage-and-security/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">problems</a> of modern banking: There are no limits to the funds you can transfer, your accounts cannot be hacked, and there is no central point of failure. As mentioned above, as of 2018, more than 1,600 cryptocurrencies are available; some popular ones are Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, and Zcash. And a new cryptocurrency crops up every single day. Considering how much growth theyâ€™re experiencing at the moment, thereâ€™s a good chance that there are plenty more to come!</p>
