<p>We'll be looking at a topic that often confuses people who are new to <a href="https://livecrypto.in/what-is-cryptocurrency-can-it-be-used-as-a-replacement-for-physical-currency/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cryptocurrency</a> - Tokens vs Coins.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2 id="h-what-is-a-token"><strong>What is a Token?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is any digital asset created on the blockchain. It is usually issued or minted on another blockchain, often existing alongside several others that belong to different projects.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anyone can easily create a crypto token by writing a bunch of computer codes or even using automated tools.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="h-what-is-a-coin"><strong>What is a Coin?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A coin is a cryptocurrency that runs on its blockchain. It is also referred to as the 'native token' of the <a href="https://livecrypto.in/blockchain-what-is-blockchain-how-does-it-work/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blockchain</a> and often serves as a way for projects to pay transaction fees while building out their applications on the same blockchain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Building out a blockchain requires many human and financial resources (millions of pounds), meaning that not everyone can launch a coin. However, anyone can create a crypto token and name it anything they want (LOL).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2 id="h-what-is-the-difference"><strong>What is the difference?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Going by the above definitions, you may already be able to tell some of the differences between crypto coins vs tokens. But weâ€™ll highlight them in the list below so that you'll have a clearer understanding:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Coins have a native blockchain, while tokens do not.</li><li>It costs less to make a token than the money spent because the former stays on the existing blockchain.</li><li>Tokens can eventually become coins when a project has its own blockchain and moves its tokens to a new blockchain as money. Successful migration cases include Binance Coin (BNB), Tron (TRX), Zilliqa (ZIL) which existed as tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.</li></ul>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Coins primarily serve as a payment cryptocurrency, while tokens on the other hand can serve a variety of use cases. For instance, have the following token classifications:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Security tokens:</strong> Security tokens are digital assets that represent traditional "security". For example, some security tokens represent a company's shares or bonds to raise money for investors.</li><li><strong>Inheritance-backed tokens:</strong> These are tokens that represent real estate assets, for example, a piece of land or gold types with tokens stored in a warehouse. Such issuance allows these assets to be sold without a specific transfer of basic assets.</li><li><strong>Invisible Tokens (NFTs):</strong> NFT tokens serve primarily as collections. Users can create NFTs for almost anything, including art, baseball, visual wealth, event tickets, etc.</li><li><strong>Stablecoins: These crypto tokens represent digital forms of fiat money. They are usually labeled 1: 1 against less money, and as a result, they are always used</strong> for the same price. Popular examples include USD Coin (USDC), Tether (USDT), and Gemini Dollar (GUSD).</li></ul>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="h-coins"><strong>Coins</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Going by the differences between token vs coins, the following cryptocurrencies qualify as coins:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Bitcoin (BTC)</li><li>Ether (ETH)</li><li>Litecoin (LTC)</li><li>Monero (XMR)</li><li>Tron (TRX)</li><li>Binance Coin (BNB)</li><li>Cardano (ADA)</li><li>Zilliqa (ZIL)</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We will use Ether (ETH) to further illustrate how crypto tokens differ from crypto coins.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="h-ether-eth-and-erc-20">Ether (ETH) and ERC-20</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ether (ETH) is a coin and a 'native token' of the Ethereum blockchain. It is the second-largest cryptocurrency in terms of market price and is widely used by developers and other network participants to pay money on the network.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, the Ethereum blockchain version allows developers to create their own tokens over the network using a standard called ERC-20. Therefore, any token created in Ethereum is appropriately called a 'token' and not a 'coin'. The title of the coin appropriately belongs to Ether (ETH), the city currency for the Ethereum network.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A good example of an ERC-20 token on Ethereum is the Basic Attention Token (BAT). BAT is used by Brave Browser developers as a user interface, allowing users to earn money to view ads and advertisers to pay for ad posts in the browser.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Other ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum include Chainlink (LINK), Tether (USDT), Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), Dai (DAI), Compound (COMP), and many more.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An easy way to tell the difference between <a href="https://livecrypto.in/what-is-cryptocurrency-can-it-be-used-as-a-replacement-for-physical-currency/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cryptocurrency</a> vs tokens is to find out if cryptocurrency has a blockchain or not. If it has a blockchain, then it's a bullet, and if it doesn't, then it's a sign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Knowing this puts you in a better position to use words correctly, either by writing or talking to people about cryptocurrency assets.</p>
